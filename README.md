# Selenium Web Automation with Python, BDD
This is my first simple framework/project/sample for automation web page testing. 
## I used:
- POM structure,
- basic folder structure for BDD,
- Selenium with Python.

## Scope of testing:
### Manual:
At the beginning I did some e2e and exploratory manual testing to check if everything works properly and find some bugs (for example visual ones). It helps me understand the site structure and find out what to test.
Bug raports with relevant screenshots are in *"bugs reports.pdf"* file.

### Automation:
For this site I used only negative test cases, because I didn't get access for using account features. At first I focused only on login site, because I assumed that it will be good choice to gain some experience and skill.

## Future:
In future I hope to add some new test cases and add other sites to my framework. I hope to improve and clean my code and maybe use some other technologies, like testing APIs.
